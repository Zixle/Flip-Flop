# Flip-Flop

This project is a Flip-Flop Circuit Simulator implemented in C++, designed to simulate basic digital logic flip-flops such as SR, JK, D, and T flip-flops. The program allows users to configure inputs, define flip-flop types, and observe the outputs based on given logic. It's purpose was to practice inhertiance and polymorphism programming concepts.
